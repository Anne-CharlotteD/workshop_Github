# My Project

Demo repository for the course

This project in R is to create calibration curves from mass spectrometric data that was generated during the validation of an LC-MS method. Calibration curves were created for >100 compounds and measured on several validation plates, validation plate A (VPA), B (VPB) and C&D (VPCD).
